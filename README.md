Lita's Bittorrent Client. This program was a learning excerise about networking by writing
Bittorrent protocals from stratch.

I used Kristen Widman's blog as a guide. Her posts were extremely helpful. 
I couldn't have gotten this far without her guide.

I also used the Bittorrent Unofficial Spec to format my packets.

Wireshark was also heavily used while debugging this software.

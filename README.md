Lita's Bittorrent Client
==========

It is now asynchronous!!!

This client is written in Python.

##Installation
This project is currently in progress so I haven't packaged it yet properly.
But you can install the necessary dependencies this way. Make a virtualenv and
within your project directory, run the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Running the program
All you need to do is pass in a valid torrent file where the tracker uses
the HTTP protocol. Still working on a UDP implementation!

`python <your torrent file>.torrent`
